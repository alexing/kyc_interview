Deliverable: the read.me
==================================

* As much as I would like to continue, I timed this and already spent around 12 hours of work in the exercise (including reading and trying to understand the paper).
* The exercise was developed in python, in a jupyter notebook and used the following libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, re, sklearn, collections, string, urllib, wordcloud and other minor python libraries

* 12 hours of work have passed
* Completely fulfilled points from 1 to 3. Started number 4 but didn't advance much.
* To run, just open the notebook on a jupyter server and have all of the libraries installed.
* I chose this format and technologies because it's the easiest to research on when you're working on data science*

* The project is public in https://github.com/alexing10/kyc_interview
