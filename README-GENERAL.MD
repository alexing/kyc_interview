First things first: It could be nice to get an email reply that you've got this and processing :)

General Candidate Evaluation Notes
==================================

* If you received this task, it means you have passed the frontal interview and we seriously considering hiring
you, way to go! :) I would also like to thank you for your time and interest in KYC Station.
* The following task is meant to (a) be fun (as much as possible for those stuff :)), and mostly (b) simulate the daily
work and test your skills. It should be done by rapidly utilizing and binding together a few state-of-the-art APIs to
create new functionality, utilizing off-the-shelf managed components as possible. Note coding a solution which is as
close as possible to the prefect functionality is very important, but also the communication, including the
documentation.
* Let's have two calls:
- The First, for before implementing to make sure you understood, to answer questions you have, and approve an initial
  design.
- The second - for a code review - please plan it for after you assign your solution plus at least one day extra for me
  to try run the code and have a look on it before the call.
- If you are in a rush (in an advanced stage of a recruitment process with another company), consider let me know so I
will do my best to accelerate the process.
- Ideally schedule the calls via https://calendly.com/ori-4/phone-call ; in case there are no availability for calls
via the Calendly system, just try to call me, and I will try to call you back whenever possible.
* If all goes well, the next steps would be: sending your references (Two past/present supervisors of yours whether from
 a workplace or university; the best would be from the recent period; they should, of course, know you well enough, and
 at the time, be aware I am about to call them to ask about you :)), meeting our CEO, and finally getting an offer.

REQUIRED DELIVERABLE
==================================
* Please work on this few evenings or 1-2 days; Do *not* invest more than that, and send a deliverable within few days.
* You do *not* have to do a perfect deliverable, or even full deliverable! If you passed 1.5-2 days of work, please:
Stop coding and wrap it up by finalizing the documentation. Anyway, please send the deliverable within few days.
* You can choose any combination of programming languages, platforms, and open-source tools you like.
* Include a README - Please include anything that might be helpful in evaluating your work e.g.:
- How much you have worked on it
- What you have accomplished vs. what was left out
- How to build, configure and run
- Why did you choose particular tools/architecture
- What have not yet implemented/working properly / Assumptions/compromises you made.
- How you would tackle better/otherwise if it was a bigger project.
* Have proper documentation inside the code, but do not document trivial things.
* All input data can be assumed to be in English only (in tasks where this is applicable).
* Bonus: Submit the project as an open project on Github/Bitbucket (Alternatively, send me a compressed file by email).

To be clear - you can use the internet but you are supposed to write all the code yourself.
Do not copy and paste code. And of course, please do *not* get help from other people.

Thanks, and Good Luck! :)
